## Dorks Finder
**Dorks Finder Google Hacking Dork Scraping and Searching Script**

Dorks Finder is a script I made in python 2. With this tool, you can easily find Google Dorks. Dork Finder collects potentially vulnerable web pages and applications on the Internet or other awesome info that is picked up by Google's search bots.

# What data can we find using Google Dorks?

Bank account details
Vulnerable websites
So much more â€¦
